# Finpro (Final Project)
Final Project Management D3RPLA / D3IF Telkom University 2019

# Abstract
D3 Application Software Engineering (D3 RPLA) is a study program at Telkom University that focuses its graduates on interactive mobile programming. D3 RPLA states that students graduate if they have worked on the Final Project and have also passed the conclave. The Final Project (PA) is a scientific work made by students. The final result of the PA at D3 RPLA is the Final Project book and Application. The final project book and application, will be tested by examiners. This testing process is called a conclave. there are several processes that must be done so that the final project book and this application are ready to be tested during the conclave. These processes are choosing a title, conducting guidance with the lecture, conducting monitoring and evaluation (Monev). Each monitoring and evaluation has a target that must be achieved by the application and the book that will be made, and until the last is a conclave. However, in carrying out the process there are various problems, for example when choosing the title of lecturer conducted on Facebook social media, this is felt to be less effective because it requires a long time. then at the time of guidance, the results of the guidance review were still done manually, namely through paper so that a lot of paper was wasted just to do guidance. Then at the time of monitoring and evaluation, students often forget to record the results of the review of the monitoring and evaluation so that students often forget which part should be corrected in the final project book and application. From the problems that have been explained, an application can be made that can solve the problem. This application has several main functionalities, namely adding a title by the supervisor, submitting an independent title, guiding records, monitoring and evaluation, and also recording the session. This application is built on the Android platform and uses the MySQL database with Laravel as a server. This application is tested using blackbox testing testing. the purpose of this test is to find out whether the application has been running as expected or not
